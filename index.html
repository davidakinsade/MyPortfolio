                            <p>The building and designing of the model are the foundation of the application.</p>
                            <p>The files that were included in the dataset had to be loaded, followed by display and evaluation of the images in the notebook.</p>
                            <p>Creating and compiling the model was also done to eventually load the model into the <b>Android Studio IDE</b> for testing.</p>
